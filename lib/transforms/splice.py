"""Splicing operations for combining overlapping time-series segments.

Three methods are supported:

* **growth_rate** – use series_b's growth rates to extend series_a backward
  or forward from the overlap year.
* **level_shift** – shift series_b by the level difference at the splice
  point so it matches series_a's scale.
* **direct** – simply concatenate, preferring series_a in the overlap.
